This program is partially implemented for an exercise to learn source code parsing.
Clone and import to your development environment.

Lecture Material (in Japanese) is available at: <https://www.slideshare.net/TakashiIshio/ss-174863168>

The `automaton` directory includes textual definitions of automata used in the material.
The files are written in Graphviz format.  
You can quickly visualize it using WebGraphviz (<http://www.webgraphviz.com/>) .
