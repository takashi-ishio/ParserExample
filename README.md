# An example program to parse source code using JavaSE-8 and ANTLR4

This program is partially implemented for an exercise to learn source code parsing.
Clone and import to your development environment (e.g. Eclipse).

Lecture Material (in Japanese) is included in this repository: <https://github.com/takashi-ishio/ParserExample/blob/master/Parsing20190923.pdf>

This branch includes some TODOs for your practice.
A complete example is included in the `implemented` branch.

The `automaton` directory includes textual definitions of automata used in the material.
The files are written in Graphviz format.  
You can quickly visualize it using WebGraphviz (<http://www.webgraphviz.com/>) .
